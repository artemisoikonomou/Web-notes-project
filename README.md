Notes project
Now I See

A minimalist journaling web application that helps users capture and reflect on their thoughts. Users can write journal entries, explore insights, and track personal growth over time in a calm, focused interface.

The project is built with Node.js, Express, EJS, and PostgreSQL (database setup included inside the project files).

To run it, install Node.js, download or clone the project, navigate to the folder in your terminal, run npm install to install dependencies, and npm start to launch the app at http://localhost:3000. All necessary dependencies are listed in package.json, and the included files allow the app to function immediately.
